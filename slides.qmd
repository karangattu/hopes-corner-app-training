## The most secretive recipe at Hope's Corner

Miguel's famous mole recipe

## Miguel writes his recipe in this book

## Every change being made is tracked on a separate page

This is the concept of version control. Every change is a **commit**.

## The recipe to be used is bookmarked.

This is the concept of a **release**.

## If Caleb wants to tweak the recipe, he will make a copy of the recipe and make his changes there.

This is the concept of a **branch**.

## If that recipe turns out to be better, Miguel can merge Caleb's changes into the original recipe.

This is the concept of a **pull request**.

## How do these concepts fit to the Hope's Corner App?

We store the recipe (code) in GitHub.

## How do people eat the recipe?

We need to cook the food _(deploy the app)_ so that people can eat _(use the app)_.

### We deploy the app to **Vercel**

## Where do we store all the data?

Like an order log of people who ate the mole, we store all the data in a database called **Supabase**.
