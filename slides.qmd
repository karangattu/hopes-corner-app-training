## The most secretive recipe at Hope's Corner

Miguel's famous mole recipe

![](assets/miguel_cooking_mole.png)

## Miguel writes his recipe in this book

![](assets/mole_recipe.png)

## Every change being made is tracked on a separate page

This is the concept of version control. Every change is a **commit**.

![](assets/making_commits.png)

## The recipe to be used is bookmarked.

![](assets/bookmark_recipe.png)

::: {.fragment}
This is the concept of a **release**.
:::


## If Caleb wants to tweak the recipe, he will make a copy of the recipe and make his changes there.


![](assets/caleb_recipe.png)

::: {.fragment}
This is the concept of a **branch**.
:::

## If that recipe turns out to be better, Miguel can merge Caleb's changes into the original recipe.

::: {.fragment}
This is the concept of a **pull request**.

## How do these concepts fit to the Hope's Corner App?

![](assets/github_logo.png)

::: {.fragment}
We store the recipe (code) in GitHub.
:::

## How do people eat the recipe?

::: {.fragment}
We need to cook the food _(deploy the code)_ so that people can eat _(use the app)_.

### We deploy the app to **Vercel**

## Where do we store all the data?

::: {.fragment}
Like an order log of people who ate the mole, we store all the data in a database called **Supabase**.
:::

::: {.fragment}

## So where is the code stored on GitHub?

::: {.fragment}
Code is stored over [here](https://github.com/hopescorner/hopes-corner-app)
:::


::: {.fragment}
The **code** is publicly available, the **data** is not.
